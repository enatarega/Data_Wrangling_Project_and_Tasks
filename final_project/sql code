-- Conclusion: Of those who completed 12 weeks of treatment (only 29), 23 had their blood pressure in control. Out of the 23, 5 had uncontrolled blood pressure in week 1. Thus, only 5 were brought from uncontrlled to controlled (this result is only for those who took the treatment upto at least week 12.
